# Rapidito - The fastest way to get a project started (or modified!)

Rapidito is a code generator that allows you to generate CRUDs, APIs, Swagger docs and much more in no-time! It has
the following features:

* Supports lots of languages: Golang, Java, PHP.
* Allows you to generate from a YAML configuration file different types of applications: REST API's, CLI's and much more.
* You configure your models and it generates database migrations, repositories and everything you need to get you started. When you
select a SQL database, it allows you to start with SQLite to try your application as soon as possible.
* It also generates a docker-compose file to test your application with real services like a MySQL database.
